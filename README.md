CAR MEETS

We have created a place where car entuathist are able to organize car meets. 



A car meet is 
a gathering of local car enthusiasts on a certain day at a certain time. We have provided a date picker allowing users to let people know of an upcoming event. We have integrated a Google API to provide the specific location of upcoming events.
